        <br>
        <h2 style="font-size: 14px;color:#494949;">Hello! Welcome to my page where I present my projects, hobbies and interests. For context, I am graduating from my double degree in Computer Science at TUM and 
            Artificial intelligence from IP Paris in the summer of 2025. I am eager to continue creating sustainable artificial intelligence that benefits our society. Currently looking for research or full-time 
            opportunities! If this piques your interest, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me!</h2>

                        <p>The K-NN Chain algorithm is a novel approach to make hierarchical agglomerative clustering more scalable. By making use of dynamic distance computation,
                            this method manages to reduce memory complexity exponentially and time complexity in a majority of cases.

                    <p> Currently audio deepfake detection methods focus on the acoustic signal and learn to spot artifacts produced by specific deepfake generators.
                        This makes them inherently brittle when deployed to real-world datasets. This project focuses therefore on leveraging both speech and text models, 
                        in order to incorporate both acoustic anomalies and a context for a given speaker, which are then fed into a classifier fine-tuned for deepfake detection.</p>

            <h2>Interests and hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Ballet</h3>
            <p>I have been dancing ballet since I was about 6 years old. It has been an integral part of my life; ballet gives me a sort of freedom of expression, and it has been a constant throughout my entire life. As an adult I still take classes, and try to improve my technique. I also dance other dances: contemporary, tango, flamenco, jazz. </p>
            <h3>Skiing</h3>
            <p>I normally ski every winter, normally in Austria, and I love it for the sport, the outdoor, the views, and the apres-ski-bars. I have skied since I was a young child. It would be my dream to go skiing in Japan, and enjoy the fantastic weather, scenery and bouncy snow!</p>
            <h3>Brain-workouts!</h3>
            <p>Whether it is finishing a Sudoku (faster than 99% on Sudoku.com), solving a rubik's cube (can solve in about 2 mins), or playing one or two rounds of chess with friends (though I absolutely am a beginner)!</p>
            <h3>Space</h3>
            <p>I find space absolutely fascinating, cool and humbling. I have worked for a Generative AI project for the chair for Pico and Nano Satellites at TUM and I have worked at the European Space Agency to integrate AI in their pipeline.</p>
            <h3>Art</h3>
            <p>I work on the odd tufting project and designing and sewing my own dresses. Other than that I highly appreciate artwork. I hope to one day open a non-profit art gallery, in attempt to incorporate art with the younger generation.</p>
            <h3>Politics and democracy</h3>
            <p>I enjoy following politics in the EU and internationally. I strongly align with european and democratic values. I would be highly motivated to continue creating AI, which could also contribute to society in some way!</p>
            <h3>Feminism</h3>
            <p>Despite progress toward gender equality, meaningful differences between the sexes still persist in various domains, particularly STEM. I firmly believe that women in these fields should be actively supported, recognised, and empowered. My commitment lies in fostering equal opportunity and upholding the principles of fairness and merit for all.</p>
